## Getting Involved  â€“ Easy Tasks

We know that as a volunteer, your time is a gift to us. We want to make it easy for you to contribute in ways large and small. Got 10 minutes to do some data entry? Great! Maybe you can write a one-off scraper? We'll take it. Adopt an entire state? Awesome. We love any and all contributors.

### Quick and Easy Ways to Help OpenElections

Look in `openelections-{state}-data` repositories for Github issues labeled as "easy task" - these are small jobs that could involve data entry, a quick scrape or conversion from a PDF file. Here is an example from [Mississippi](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ms/labels/easy%20task) and here are others from [Ohio](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-oh/labels/easy%20task).

For these one-off files, you can either write code to convert the data into CSVs that match our [standard](http://docs.openelections.net/archive-standardization/), or you can do data entry or even copy HTML tables and clean them up. It's up to you. If you do contribute code, take a look at [how we do it](http://docs.openelections.net/guide/preprocessing/) and please don't hesitate to ask us any questions. All CSV output files should go in year-specific folders in the specific `openelections-{state}-data` repository, but if you're not familiar with Git or Github, that's fine - you can email us the finished CSVs at openelections@gmail.com. Thanks!
