<h4>Everything you need to know about OpenElections</h4>

<p>Welcome to the OpenElections documentation! This site is here to help you become familiar with the project's goals, how it works and how you can help.</p>


<h5>A little about us</h5>

<p>The goal of OpenElections is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices.

No freely available comprehensive source of official election results exists. The current options for election data can be difficult to find and use or financially out-of-reach for most journalists and civic hackers. We want the people who work with election data to be able to get what they need, whether thatâ€™s a CSV file for stories and data analysis or JSON usable for web applications and interactive graphics. We've got a <a href="http://blog.openelections.net/">blog</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openelections">Google Group</a> and our code is <a href="https://github.com/openelections">on Github</a>.
