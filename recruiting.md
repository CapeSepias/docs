## Recruiting More Volunteers

We all know that the offices that are providing us with results data didn't really have OpenElections or open access in mind when constructing the data. For that reason, one of the key factors that will determine how quickly this initiative is completed is the number of volunteers we have helping to carry out the legwork that moves us closer to our end goal.

Simply put, by recruiting one more person who helps us with anything, technical or otherwise, you are directly contributing to the success of OpenElections.

## Task description

The inputs to this task are time and effort telling people about OpenElections.

The outputs to this task are new contributions to the efforts that we've listed on our main volunteer page.

## How to complete this task

Find a friend and show them how easy it is to contribute! You don't have to know how to code in order to make a meaningful difference. For example, you could [convert a full set of raw results](http://docs.openelections.net/guide/converting) in only 20-30 minutes using just Excel.

Our challenge to you is to convert one of these documents yourself and then show a friend how easy it was. Simple as that.

For people who do want to code, we have major initiatives that we're looking for help with: writing scrapers, implementing a state's processing pipeline and addressing core repo issues. Developer time is hard to get, so we appreciate any thought that goes into these.
