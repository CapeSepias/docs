## Volunteer Cheatsheet -- The Initial Data Interview

### A cheatsheet for the initial interview with election data sources.  

Below are some suggested questions. The overall goal is to get a sense of the elections data landscape for a state, and of course, to identify the best source of certified results.  

### Questions

*Can you describe the election data lifecycle in your state, from pre-election data gathering (e.g. candidate lists) to post-election results certification?*

*Can you describe the results certification process? How does data certified at the local level filter up to the state?*  

*Is it possible for certified state results to not match certified results from sub-state jurisdictions?* 

*What software systems does your state use to manage its data?* 

*What is the cleanest, richest source of certified results data in your state?* 

*Is precinct-level data available? If not, what levels of breakdown are available?*  

*Are there any idiosyncrasies in the data or hidden landmines that require special attention?*  

*Does the state have open or closed primaries and primary runoffs? Has that status changed since 2000?*  

*Anything else we should know about the data that we havenâ€™t asked?*
