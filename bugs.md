## Getting Involved  â€“ Bugs

Converting election results isn't a perfect process - sometimes we make mistakes and need to fix them. That can involve tracking down a better source file for results or fixing a scraper or script that converts existing results into CSV files. If you see a problem with our converted data, please create an issue in the appropriate GitHub repository (and if you don't know where that is, just email us at openelections@gmail.com).
